# Flask Backend
Python application developed using the Flask framework to communicate with the our postgresql db. 

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.13
* Postgresql14

## Running container 

> _**NOTE:**_ Make sure the database is running before running the application. 

1. Build the container

```shell
docker image build -t flask_docker .
```

2. Run the container

```shell
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d flask_docker
```

3. stop container

Find the CONTAINER ID using: `docker ps` 

```shell
docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### Removing Containers
1. Find the container id you want to delete
```shell
docker ps -a
```

2. Remove container 
```shell
docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
```

## Running Locally (Prod)

## Running Locally (Dev)

1. Create a virtual environment. (Skip this step if you already have a venv folder)

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate virtual environment
    * Linux
    ```shell
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    * Windows
    ```powershell
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

> Ensure VS Code has the right interpreter selected by using the command palette `CMD+SHIFT+P`, select `Python: Select Interpreter` select `venv` option, if not, type the path to the interpreter (venv/bin).  

3. Install dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run Application

Ensure that `.flaskenv` is provided

```shell
flask run --debug
```


5. Exit venv

```shell
deactivate
```

## Testing the Application

A Test driven development is meant to be used with this application and therefore pytest framework is being used.

1. Create a database called primalfit_test inside pgAdmin.

2. To launch the tests, do the following command:

```shell
pytest
```

## Seeding the Database
> Make sure you are inside the devcontainer

1. Test to see if models.py compiles

```shell
python models.py
```

2. seed the database by running the following file:
```shell
python init_db.py
```

3. Confirm tables where created inside pgAdmin 4 `primalFit`

4. If you wish to drop all tables in db. Run the following file:
```shell
python drop_db.py
```
