# Group Retrospective
Please provide responses for the following items. In all cases, you should be polite and professional. This is a public document which should appear in your GitHub Repository.

* What went well in the group...
	- Good communication between most team members by meeting regularly via discord or in person. 
	- Most of the team got along very well with each other and got lunch together often. 
	- We have made good friends along the way, its not about the destination its about the journey. 
* What could have been better in the group...
	- Merging the back-end and front-end together towards the end of the project was difficult as each group only knew their forte and not both. 
	- There was no common stlying on the front end as some people used CSS and others used Tailwind, this caused alot of issue with communicating between the people in that group. 
	- Our time management could greatly improved as we complete alot of the coding in the last couple weeks of the project. 
* What went well in the class...
	- Guest speaker session was very informative to know how the skills we learned in class are used in the real world
	- Joey was a very professional and knowledgeable GTA 
	- Being able to chose our own topic and not having a professor teach a specific method of doing tasks was nice. It promoted alot of self-learning.
	- Learning about software engineering theories was very practical (e.g. when to use singleton)
* What could have been better in the class...
	- Clear deadlines, set by the professor, for documents such as the design.md and requirements.md could give struggling groups more structure. 
	- More definitive instructions for certain documents would have been beneficial, as there were many time where our group had to ask repetitively for clarity. 
	- Giving an example document completed by previous students or a mock document would be very helpful to group misunderstanding the rubric.
