## Lessons Learned
- Dilean:
    - I learned that in this career, things are not always as the seem. The hiring market is horrible, employers are overworking their employees and job stability is decreasing steadily. 
- Aziz:
    - I learned that the self inquiry is important part not just in programming but in every other aspects as reassuring your self that you are what you are helps reaffirm your position and confidence and avoids imposter syndrome
- Jinho: 
    - I learned that we need to learn stuff behind the hood. Programming Languages come and go, but the fundamental concepts under the hood stays. Similarly, knowing myself will be helpful to be successful at whatever field I'm in.
- Revanth:
    - I learned that embracing challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone is crucial for growth, especially in programming. Facing difficult tasks head-on not only improves my skills but also builds resilience and adaptability. This mindset helps me stay motivated, overcome self-doubt, and contribute more effectively to my teamâ€™s success. 
- David:
    - I learned that you shouldn't try to sound smart and to just "put the fries in the bag bro". Basically you shouldn't try to bloat your answers with "sophisticated" material just for the sake of sounding smart. Getting the answer in the shortest way is most often the best way.
